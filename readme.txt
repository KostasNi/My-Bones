/******************************************************************
This is my take on the [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) starter theme.

Bones
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
